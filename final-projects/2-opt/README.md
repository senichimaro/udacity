# Would You Rather?

This is the second project in the React Nanodegree Program by Udacity.

The aim is to use React and Redux to build a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game.

The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules. In the app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

The project has been bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## TL;DR

To get started:

* install all project dependencies with `yarn install`
* start the app with `yarn start`
* access the app on http://localhost:3000/

## Backend Server

To simplify the development process, Udacity has provided a pseudo backend server for students to develop against. The [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-would-you-rather-starter) contains the methods needed to perform necessary operations on the backend. The required files have been incorporated into this project.

## Important

As the app works with a pseudo backend server, there is no data persistence and hence, any new questions or answers will be lost by performing a browser refresh.
